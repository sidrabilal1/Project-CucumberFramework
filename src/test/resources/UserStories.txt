User Story: Login Validation for HRMs Portal
As a user attempting to log into the HRM portal,
I want clear and specific error messages during the login process,
So that I can understand if my login attempt failed due to missing fields or incorrect credentials.

Acceptance Criteria:
If a user attempts to log in with an empty username field, the system should display an error message stating "Username cannot be empty."
2. If a user attempts to log in with an empty password field, the system should display an error message stating "Password is empty."
3. If a user enters incorrect login credentials (either the wrong username or password), the system should display an error message stating "Invalid credentials."
4. The error messages should be clear and easily visible to the user, ideally placed near the respective input fields.
5. After displaying the error message, the system should allow the user to correct their input and attempt to log in again.
User Story: Add Employee to HRMS
As an admin user,
I want to be able to add an employee to the HRMS application, either with or without providing a unique employee ID,
So that the system can generate or accept a unique employee ID and store the employee's details properly.

Acceptance Criteria:
An admin user should be able to add an employee to the HRMS application without providing an employee ID. The system should automatically generate a unique employee ID for the new employee.
  - Required fields for this process:
    - First Name
    - Middle Name (optional)
    - Last Name
2. An admin user should also have the option to add an employee to the HRMS application by providing a unique employee ID.
  - Required fields for this process:
    - First Name
    - Middle Name (optional)
    - Last Name
    - Employee ID
3. The system should provide appropriate error messages or prompts for users who attempt to submit incomplete or invalid employee information. Error messages should be:
  - Clear
  - Easily visible
  - Placed near the respective input fields.
